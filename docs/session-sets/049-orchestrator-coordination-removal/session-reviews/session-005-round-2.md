## VERIFIED

- `CLAUDE.md` close-out intent matches §5 S5: the old hard-coordination section is described as retired, the new post-Set-049 orchestrator-block contract is present, and the version walk is advanced to **0.24.0** with prior entries demoted.
- `pyproject.toml` / `ai_router/__init__.py` / `ai_router/CHANGELOG.md` are internally consistent at **0.11.0**.
- `tools/dabbler-ai-orchestration/package.json` / `tools/dabbler-ai-orchestration/CHANGELOG.md` are internally consistent at **0.24.0**.
- `ai_router/CHANGELOG.md` backfills for **0.8.0 / 0.9.0 / 0.10.0** are broadly aligned with the extension-side history excerpts.
- `change-log.md` does include S1–S5 narrative plus commit references.

## ISSUES FOUND

- **Issue** → Workflow doc says Full-tier `close_session` writes the per-session orchestrator block, but the set’s own S2/S3/S5 artifacts say `start_session` writes it.  
  **Location** → `docs/ai-led-session-workflow.md`, “Orchestrator identity and concurrency (post-Set-049)” → “Tier symmetry.”  
  **Fix** → Change to “the tooling / `start_session` writes the per-session orchestrator block automatically on Full tier,” or equivalent.

- **Issue** → UAT examples use `--engine claude-code` / expect `engine: "claude-code"`, which conflicts with locked T3 + S3 text saying Claude passes `engine=claude`.  
  **Location** → `docs/session-sets/049-orchestrator-coordination-removal/049-orchestrator-coordination-removal-uat-checklist.json`, Claude-based items under “Orchestrator block shape” and “CLI backward compatibility.”  
  **Fix** → Normalize examples to `claude`; if `claude-code` is an accepted alias, document that explicitly in the checklist and schema docs.

- **Issue** → UAT coverage does not fully satisfy §5 S5. It lacks an explicit **Full-tier clean `close_session`** end-to-end check, and cancel/restore coverage only exercises restore → `start_session`, not restore → `close_session`.  
  **Location** → `049-orchestrator-coordination-removal-uat-checklist.json`.  
  **Fix** → Add explicit items for: (1) Full-tier start→close end-to-end, and (2) post-restore `close_session` cleanliness; optionally add a clearer Lightweight end-to-end start/close flow item.

- **Issue** → Session 5 change log says verification was **Round A only**, which contradicts spec §5 S5 and the S5 close-reason/disposition stating final-session **Round B** is required.  
  **Location** → `docs/session-sets/049-orchestrator-coordination-removal/change-log.md`, Session 5 → “Verification: Round A only …”  
  **Fix** → Update to Round A + Round B, or mark Round B pending until this review is recorded.

- **Issue** → UAT checklist path is wrong in the change log.  
  **Location** → `change-log.md`, Session 5 bullet linking `uat-checklist.md`.  
  **Fix** → Point to `049-orchestrator-coordination-removal-uat-checklist.json`, or rename the artifact consistently.

- **Issue** → Cost/runtime-mode narrative is internally inconsistent. S2–S4 in `change-log.md` say Full + `requiresE2E:false` short-circuited to a zero-cost stub; S5 close-reason says routed verification still runs on Full and only `--no-router` / Lightweight short-circuit.  
  **Location** → `change-log.md` S2/S3/S4 cumulative-cost notes vs `s5-close-reason.md` “Cost.”  
  **Fix** → Reconcile the runtime-mode explanation and update the cumulative cost table/text to one consistent rule.
